<p class="boldbodycopy"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
The release of Oracle 12c introduced so many new features that I initially missed the introduction of three new job types in the <strong><tt>DBMS_SCHEDULER</tt></strong> PL/SQL package.
These job types were:
<ul>
 <li><strong><tt>SHELL_SCRIPT</tt></strong></li>
 <li><strong><tt>SQL_SCRIPT</tt></strong></li>
 <li><strong><tt>BACKUP_SCRIPT</tt></strong></li>
</ul>
The job types are what one would assume considering their name. They offer a huge advantage over pre 12c RMAN automation efforts: They enable RMAN backup automization completely from
inside the database and in a operating system independent manner. Just by creating some Scheduler objects in the database.<br>
<br>
While some scheduler objects (Jobs, Programs, Schdules, Credentials) in the database are sufficient to have backups taken at specified times, more is needed to implement a
backup strategy. One will want to be able to change passwords, monitor success or failure of backup jobs, temporarily suspend backups etc.<br>
I have created the PL/SQL package <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong> to help implementing an often used backup strategy: Daily and Weekly backups. Thanks to the new
Scheduler job types the package works regardless if the operating system of the database server is Linux, Unix or Windows. By RMAN default, and the package does not change that,
backups are written to the Fast Recovery Area (FRA) if one is configured. If not, the default location is the <strong><tt>dbs</tt></strong> (Linux/Unix) or
the <strong><tt>database</tt></strong> (Windows) subdirectory of the <strong><tt>ORACLE_HOME</tt></strong>.
</p>
<a id="PREREQ" name="PREREQ"></a>
<p class="boldbodycopy"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
<ul>
 <li>Oracle Database 12c</li>
 <li>a text editor and SQL*Plus (or SQL Developer)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<a id="INSTAL" name="INSTAL"></a>
<p class="boldbodycopy"><strong>Installation and Setup</strong></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
To install, run the provided file <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP.sql</tt></strong> through SQL*Plus:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
SQL*Plus> sqlplus / as sysdba @SCHEDULER_BACKUP.sql
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
This will create and compile two packages in the database: The main package <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong> and a small helper package
<strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP_TYPES</tt></strong>. The previous step was only to make sure that the installation works without producing errors or warnings. We need to
recompile the package every time we change the configuration. There are various options of how to edit and compile PL/SQL packages. You can change the file
<strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP.sql</tt></strong> with a text editor and rerun it through SQL*Plus, or you can work on the package in SQL Developer. 
To configure the package, find the following code segment in the Package Specification of <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong>:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
  -- RMAN commands for daily backup
  g_daily_commands constant varchar2(400) :=
         'backup check logical incremental level 1 for recover of copy with tag ''daily incr'' database;'
      || 'recover copy of database with tag ''daily incr'' until time ''sysdate-3'';'
      || 'backup check logical as compressed backupset archivelog all not backed up delete all input;';

  -- RMAN commands for weekly backup
  g_weekly_commands constant varchar2(400) :=
         'backup check logical as compressed backupset database tag ''full backup'';'
      || 'backup check logical as compressed backupset archivelog all not backed up delete all input;'
      || 'delete noprompt obsolete;';

  -- RMAN configuration commands
  -- NOTE: RMAN configuration is only done if one of the dbms_scheduler.setup
  --       routines is called with Parameter rman_configuration=>true
  g_rman_configuration_commands constant varchar2(400) :=
         'configure retention policy to recovery window of 30 days;'
      || 'configure backup optimization off;'
      || 'configure default device type to disk;'
      || 'configure controlfile autobackup on;'
      || 'configure device type disk parallelism 1 backup type to compressed backupset;'
      || 'configure compression algorithm ''HIGH'' as of release ''DEFAULT'' optimize for load true;';
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
Obviously, the preceding code segment shows the RMAN commands for daily and weekly backup and commands to configure RMAN. Edit these to suit your needs. Be careful
with quotes and the string continuation sign. You see from the example how it works. Next, edit the schedule. This code segment is just below the RMAN commands:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
  -- the repeat interval for daily and weekly backup
  -- NOTE: No daily backup on Saturday because we have a Job Chain for Saturday
  --       that starts jobs for daily and weekly backups
  g_daily_repeat_interval constant user_scheduler_jobs.repeat_interval%type :=
                                              'freq=daily;byday=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SUN;byhour=5;byminute=10';
  g_weekly_repeat_interval constant user_scheduler_jobs.repeat_interval%type :=
                                              'freq=daily;byday=SAT;byhour=5;byminute=10';
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
most likely you will not want your backups to start at 05:10 in the morning. In case you don't want to start the backup jobs by schedule at all, you can have them started
in the Maintenance Windows defined by the Oracle Database. You will find this section in the Package Specification of <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong>:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
  -- this flag switches between schedules defined by g_{daily|weekly}_repeat_interval
  -- and windows based scheduling
  --
  -- windows based schedule : Backups happen during the nightly and weekend maintenance window
  --
  --               schedule : Backups happen according to schedule defined in this package
  --
  -- after changing the value, recompile and call scheduler_backup.setup without arguments
  -- to leave the credentials untouched but to recreate the other scheduler objects
  g_use_scheduler_windows constant boolean := false;
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
So if you want to run the backup jobs during the maintenance windows, set <strong><tt>g_use_scheduler_windows</tt></strong> to <strong><tt>true</tt></strong>.
There is one important difference between scheduling by window or by time: A job that is associated with a window is only started when the window is open. To put it
to an extreme, imagine a database that is shut down every evening before the window opens and is started in the morning after the window is closed. None of the jobs
associated with the window will ever be executed, due to the rule that a job is only started when the associated window is open (windows can be opened manually by
calling <strong><tt>DBMS_SCHEDULER.OPEN_WINDOW</tt></strong>).<br>
When scheduling by time, a job that could not be started by the scheduler because the database was closed at the scheduled time, is started as soon as the database is opened
again.<br><br>
To enable debug output from the package, make sure <strong><tt>set serveroutput on</tt></strong> has been set in your session and that the package has been compiled with
this flag set to true:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
  -- if true some routines use dbms_output.put_line
  g_debug_output constant boolean := true;
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
Backup Jobs perform a check to decide if a backup should be performed or not. The flag <strong><tt>g_disable_after_failed_check</tt></strong> controls the behavior when
the check fails. See the comment in the following code segment of the Package Specification of <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong>:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
  -- scheduler_backup.backup only runs the backup job after
  -- a check of instance and database state.
  -- this flag controls what happens after the check fails:
  -- true : backups are permanently disabled until someone calls scheduler_backup.enable
  -- false: only the backup scheduled to run at the time of check is skipped.
  g_disable_after_failed_check constant boolean := false;
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
If you have gone through the above configuration, compile the package and create the scheduler objects by calling the <strong><tt>SETUP</tt></strong> procedure of
<strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong>. The <strong><tt>SETUP</tt></strong> procedure needs information about the operating system account that will execute
RMAN and the database account RMAN will connect to:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
begin
  scheduler_backup.setup(os_username=>'oracle',os_password=>'onlyiknowit',
                         db_username=>'sys',db_password=>'onlyiknowthisonealso');
end;
/
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
this will allow the setup routine to create the Credentials for OS and DB access. Credentials are a way to let someone access something without having them to know the password.<br>
<strong>Caution:</strong> Queries of <strong><tt>GV$SQL</tt></strong> will reveal the above command exposing the passwords in clear text. According to your security demands it might be
necessary to call setup from a restricted session and to restart the instance afterwards.<br>
Once the <strong><tt>SETUP</tt></strong> procedure has been provided with the account information, the procedure can be called without any arguments. This will recreate all objects
except the credentials. So if you change anything in the package and recompile, just call <strong><tt>SETUP</tt></strong> again without any arguments to implement the changes.
</p>
<a id="HANDLI" name="HANDLI"></a>
<p class="boldbodycopy"><strong>Handling the <tt>DBMS_SCHEDULER</tt> Package</strong></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
Now that backups run from jobs started by the scheduler, how can the output of the RMAN sessions be retrieved or the the success and failure of jobs be monitored?<br>
To get a list of the objects that have been created by the <strong><tt>SETUP</tt></strong> procedure, use this query:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
SQL*Plus> -- query status of scheduler objects scheduler_backup has created
SQL*Plus> select * from table(scheduler_backup.status);

COLUMN_VALUE
-----------------------------------------------------
       job : BACKUP_JOB_DAILY, enabled: TRUE
       job : BACKUP_JOB_WEEKLY, enabled: TRUE
       job : BACKUP_WORKER_DAILY, enabled: FALSE
       job : BACKUP_WORKER_WEEKLY, enabled: FALSE
   program : BACKUP_DAILY_PRGM, enabled: TRUE
   program : BACKUP_WEEKLY_PRGM, enabled: TRUE
     chain : BACKUP_CHAIN_WEEKLY, enabled: TRUE
credential : BACKUP_DB_CREDENTIAL
credential : BACKUP_OS_CREDENTIAL

9 rows selected.
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
The two <strong><tt>WORKER</tt></strong> Jobs above are disabled intentionally: They are not directly started by the scheduler.<br><br>
To query the state of jobs from <strong><tt>all_scheduler_jobs</tt></strong>:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
select job_name,owner,state,next_run_date from all_scheduler_jobs where job_name like 'BACKUP_%';
</pre><br>
<p class="bodycopy">
To see the success or failure of previous job runs, use this query:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
select log_id,job_name,status,binary_output,log_date,run_duration from all_scheduler_job_run_details order by log_date desc;
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
The column <strong><tt>BINARY_OUTPUT</tt></strong> of <strong><tt>ALL_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS</tt></strong> contains the RMAN output of the <strong><tt>WORKER</tt></strong> Jobs
as <strong><tt>BLOB</tt></strong>. An easy way to make the output visible is to execute the query from a worksheet in SQL Developer and double click into the
<strong><tt>(BLOB)</tt></strong> field of the output. This opens a pop-up revealing the text after checking the 'Text' checkbox.<br>
<br>
More queries and calls of <strong><tt>SCHEDULER_BACKUP</tt></strong> procedures are in the file <strong><tt>schedulernew.sql</tt></strong> that is delivered with
this package. I recommend opening <strong><tt>schedulernew.sql</tt></strong> in SQL Developer and execute the commands from there.

<p class="boldbodycopy"><strong>Deinstalling the <tt>DBMS_SCHEDULER</tt> Package</strong></p>
<p class="bodycopy">
Why would you want that? If you really need to, start by removing all objects the package has created:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
-- drops all objects scheduler_backup.setup has created
SQL*Plus> exec scheduler_backup.drop_objects;
</pre>
<p class="bodycopy">
Then drop the two packages:
</p>
<pre class="dba_community_code">
SQL*Plus> drop package scheduler_backup;
SQL*Plus> drop package scheduler_backup_types;
