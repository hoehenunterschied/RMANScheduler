PL/SQL Package SCHEDULER_BACKUP Readme
======================================

Installation:
-------------
bash> sqlplus / as sysdba
SQL*Plus> @SCHEDULER_BACKUP
SQL*Plus> begin
scheduler_backup.setup(os_username=>'oracle',os_password=>'kennenurich',
                       db_username=>'sys',db_password=>'kenneauchnurich');
end;
/

Usage:
------
After the SCHEDULER_BACKUP package has been installed into the database,
use SQL Developer to open the package specification. Change the commands
for daily and weekly backup, the schedule, the flags (descriptions
are in the package specification) to adapt to your needs. Recompile the
package.
Caution: Changing the package specification does not change the Scheduler
objects (Credentials, Jobs, Programs) the package has created. To implement
changes you made in the specification, call

SQL*Plus> exec scheduler_backup.setup

without parameters from SQL*Plus. This will recreate all objects except the
Credentials, thus implementing changes you made in the package.

Load schedulernew.sql into a SQL Developer worksheet. It contains examples how
to use the package and SQL queries to get the state of this package's scheduler
objects. It is even possible to retrieve RMAN output through SQL.
